Welcome to Gridiron (kinda)

Gonna be honest, not much works.
What does work:
	Shortcut directly into mod using "+set fs_game modname"
	A README file (who could have guessed)
	A grenade launcher that launches farther, doesnt bounce, does no damage, and tells you if the person who caught it was a teammate or enemy in the console
	A help menu visible from the main menu and pause menu
	A hud mod that does nothing, was planned to keep score and time
